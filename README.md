# Dynamic Memory & Data Structures Exercises

This repository contains a collection of exercises focused on **dynamic memory allocation, pointers, vectors, matrices, and data structures** implemented in Pascal. It demonstrates practical skills in memory management, dynamic arrays, and safe memory disposal.

## Features / Exercises

### 1. Search Algorithms
- **Sequential (Linear) Search**  
- **Binary Search** on sorted arrays  

### 2. Dynamic Vectors
- Allocate, resize, insert, and delete elements dynamically  
- Extract even numbers into a new dynamic vector  

### 3. Dynamic Matrices
- Allocate, fill, display, and free dynamic matrices  
- Sum two matrices  
- Transpose a matrix  

### 4. String Operations
- Dynamic vector of positions for substring occurrences  
- Search for a substring at specific positions  

### 5. Memory Management
- Proper use of `Allocate` and `Free` for dynamic memory  
- Avoid memory leaks  
- Pointer-to-pointer logic for matrices  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation  
- Pointer manipulation and stability  
- Indexing and element access in 1D and 2D dynamic arrays  
- Algorithm implementation (search, sort, insert, delete)  
- Safe handling of strings and dynamic sequences
